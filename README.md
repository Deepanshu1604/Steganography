# Steganography

The method employed in the provided code is the Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography technique, utilizing the OpenCV library for image processing and NumPy for numerical operations. What makes this solution innovative and creative is its simplicity and efficiency. The customization involves embedding binary representations of characters in the image's RGB channels, seamlessly concealing text within the pixels.
This approach stands out for its ease of implementation and educational value, making steganography accessible for users exploring the concept. The code's remarkable feature lies in its practicality for educational purposes and scenarios where a straightforward method for hiding text within images is sufficient. It serves as an introductory tool to the world of steganography, offering a hands-on experience in a user-friendly manner.The solution outlined here provides a fundamental implementation of image steganography, specifically designed for concealing text within images.

The program offers features for both encoding (hiding) and decoding (revealing) messages within image files. It employs the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to modify pixel values, embedding binary representations of characters within the red, green, and blue channels of an image.
